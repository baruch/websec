=head1 NAME

url.list - websec url monitoring configuration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The URL list consists of one or more sections separated by newlines. You can
have sections without a URL, they will update the defaults for all the
subsequenet blocks. The Name and Prefix parameters are required as well as one
of Email, EmailLink and Program. The rest are completely optional.

The following parameters (case-sensitive) are recognized in each section:

    URL        - URL of web page to monitor

    Name       - Name of web site. Pages delivered to you will have the
                 following format: "Name - Date (Day)" eg. "PC Magazine - 4
                 Sep 98 (Fri)"

    Prefix     - Prefix of filenames for archive files of web pages created
                 by Web Secretary.

    Email      - Comma-delimited list of email addresses to send highlighted
                 pages to.

    EmailLink  - Comma-delimited list of email addresses to send URL of
                 changed pages to.

    Program    - application to call with the diff-file, special cases:
                 "mozilla", pages are opened in new tabs,
                 "konqueror", pages are opened using "kfmclient openURL"

    Auth       - Authentication information in "username:password" format. 
                 Put "none" if no authentication needed.

    Diff       - Put "none" if you want Web Secretary to always mail this
                 page to you instead of checking for and highlighting
                 changes in the page.  Put "webdiff" if you want Web
                 Secretary to check for changes.
                 Put "htmldiff" to use a different implementation of HTML
                 diff output. Note that you need to install the perl-modules
                 Algorithm::Diff and HTML::Diff which are availabe on 
                 http://www.cpan.org/ for this to work.

    Hicolor   -  Color used to highlight new or changed content. Currently,
                 four colors are defined. They are: blue, pink, yellow and
                 grey. You can also supply your own HTML color tag in the
                 form "#rrggbb".

    Ignore     - Comma-delimited List of section names containing ignore
                 keywords. There must be NO SPACES between delimiters and
                 section names. The ignore sections and keywords are stored
                 in a file called "ignore.list".

    IgnoreURL  - Comma-delimited List of section names containing ignore
                 URLs. There must be NO SPACES between delimiters and
                 section names. The ignore sections and keywords are stored
                 in a file called "ignore.list".

    AsciiMarker - If set to 1 it will add ascii markers around the changes so
	             that highlighting is noticeable in text mode too. Useful for
				 text MUAs users.

    Tmin       - Every token containing <= Tmin words will not be highlighted
                 for differences.

    Tmax       - Every token containing >= Tmax words will not be checked for
                 ignore keywords.

    Proxy      - Specify proxy "http://your.proxy.here:portnum" if you are
                 using one. (Alternatively, you can make use of the
                 "http_proxy" environment variable)

    ProxyAuth  - Specify proxy authentication in "username:password" format.
                 The code for this feature was contributed by Volker Stampa.

    MailFrom   - The E-Mail address to send mail from, this can be left empty
                 and the user used to run websec will be used.

    ProgramDigest - If specified "true", websec does not open all changed pages 
                 separately with the application specified in "Program", but opens
                 a summary page that contains links to all changed pages. 

    Digest     - true|false or yes|no. This works only if EmailLink is
                 specified. It consolidates all the changed URLs and sends
                 them in one email.

    UserAgent  - The User-Agent that will be sent by the web client. This can
                 be used to bypass servers that prevent access based on the user
                 agent.

    DateFMT    - Date format to use in e-mail messages, can be empty for no date.
                 Set it to " - %Y-%m-%d" for ISO dates. This is perl format for dates.

    RandomWait - Websec waits for a random number of seconds between retries up
                 to the value specified by the RandomWait keyword. This is to
                 prevent websec from being blocked by websites that perform log
                 analysis to find time similarities between requests.

Any line which begins with a '#' is treated as comment and ignored.

If a section does not contain a URL entry, the values provided will be
treated as the default for the following sections.

For example,

    # Defaults
    Auth = none
    Diff = webdiff
    Hicolor = blue
    Ignore = General,Date_Time
    IgnoreURL = Adverts
    Tmin = 1
    Tmax = 10
    Proxy = http://proxy.nus.edu.sg:8080
    Email = vchew@post1.com

    # Web page to monitor which does not require authentication
    URL = http://browserwatch.iworld.com/news.html 
    Name = Browser Watch
    Prefix = browsewatch

    # New defaults with authentication information
    Auth = user:password

    # More web pages to monitor which requires authentication
    URL = http://www.infoworld.com
    Name = Infoworld
    Prefix = infoworld

    URL = http://developer.javasoft.com/
    Name = Java Developer Central
    Prefix = jdc
