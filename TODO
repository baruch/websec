Next Release
------------

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/websec/message/79 has an elisp mode to highlight
url.list.
  + need an equivalent from vim.
  + Find out where to install the emacs mode
  ? Fix it, it seems broken, need user input on this.

Adam Stanley provided patches to add:
 + 'MailFrom', the address from which the mail will come from.
 - 'DiffOnly', send only the difference, as opposed to whole document with highlighted differences
 + Follow Refresh zero, Follow links if the site uses refresh zero.


Short Term
----------

B3450, Inconsistency with the .websec/url.list location finding and using websec with a file parameter.

Run the html output of webdiff through a text mode browser for the benefit of
text MUA users. This, coupled with the DiffOnly patch will provide an
approximate for the request of Daniel Fraga.

B3497, Show also removed content from the html page, possibly use HTML::Diff

Enable running multiple websec instances at the same time:
MSG70 - see below
  - Implement

Send mail from windows:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/websec/message/21
  - Improve mail sending

Problem with script pages (eg Slashdot):
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/websec/message/35 
  - Check if needed

Patch to remove script/noscript:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/websec/message/38
  - Check if needed, related to Slashdot issues.

Multi-User patches and RPM spec:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/websec/message/45
  - Investigate

B3449, Notify when pages in url.list haven't been updated for a long time.

B3472, Provide a method to specify how often to check for changes, mostly for dialup users.
Can also be used for a constantly running program.


Long Term
---------

Keep a website as an image to be put in the desktop background.
MSG72 - see below
  - Investigate

Create GUI for websec, similar to kwebwatch, but implement the GUI with Perl
bindings, this will allow wxWindows bindings for windows and gtk/qt bindings for
Linux.
  - Implement, need to modulrize websec to work as a library and have differt
    GUI, where 'text' is one of them and is the same as now, a simple command
    line.

Hi,

I use a lot of cron'ed websec and sometimes 2 or more websec runs at
the same time creating (I think) a race condition. Sometimes I get
weird HTML email where the subject and the body doesn't match.

So I think this should fix it.

Seiji T.

P.S. Bottom part of the diff adds no caching keyword to the request
which isn't related to this issue. BTW, "max-age=..." seems to be
automatically added to "Cache-Control" probably by LWP, so I don't
know if it's valid.

Hi!
I just wanted to know if (and how) it is possible to save an hourly changed 
web site (gif image) to my local hard disk (and use it as desktop background) 
instead of letting it by emailed to me.
thanx
