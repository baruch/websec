Next Release
------------

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/websec/message/79 has an elisp mode to highlight
url.list.
  + need an equivalent from vim.

Adam Stanley provided patches to add:
 + 'MailFrom', the address from which the mail will come from.
 - 'DiffOnly', send only the difference, as opposed to whole document with highlighted differences
 - Follow Refresh zero, Follow links if the site uses refresh zero.


Short Term
----------

B3450, Inconsitency with the .websec/url.list location finding and using websec with a file parameter.

Run the html output of webdiff through a text mode browser for the benefit of

approximate for the request of Daniel Fraga.

  - Investigate

Create GUI for websec, similar to kwebwatch, but implement the GUI with Perl

Linux.

    GUI, where 'text' is one of them and is the same as now, a simple command
