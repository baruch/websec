1.9.0 - Released on 20-Jan-2006

    * Add support for If-Modified-Since and keep last modified data to reduce
      bandwidth usage by not retrieving the file at all if it hadn't changed.
      (Patch from Patric Mueller)

    * Add meta tag to keep the charset as provided by the HTTP server.
      This enables the mail reader to later show the file with the correct
      encoding. Solves bug #10980 in Savannah.

    * If url.list is missing do not hang but report to the user and exit.
      Solves bug #349024 in Debian.

1.8.0 - Released on 02-Jan-2005

    * Support for diffing with HTML::Diff from CPAN, this has support to show
      the removed text in addition to the changed text. (not working yet)

    * Special support for konqueror for Program directive.

    * Replace TABLE tags with SPAN tags to highlight differences, this is
      reported to work better for some users.

    * Accept keywords for url.list in all cases.
    
    * Use sendmail from /usr/sbin/ if it's no available in /usr/lib/, this
      fixes a problem with RedHat 9. (Thanks to Michael Wittman)

    * Follow refresh links, this is useful to pass automatic forwarding pages.
      (Thanks to Adam Stanley)

    * Allow using a URL list file other than url.list (Thanks to Sacha
      Fournier)

    * Fix bug when having several websec instances running at the same time.

    * Multiple small bug fixes

1.7.0 - Released on 31-May-2003

    * Add MailFrom, to set the address from which the mail will appear to come.
      (Thanks to Adam Stanley)

    * Added URL to the mail subject, to simplify jumping to a changed page from
      the mail folder.

    * Added an EmailError option to disable sending error messages. This was
      requested numerous times (Bug#3498 on Savannah), this fix is based on a
      patch from Peter Bieringer.

    * Add man pages for url.list and ignore.list, removed their documentation
      from the README file and moved it to the files themselves for easier
      reference.

    * Add "ascii" color highlighting from Javier M. Mora. Instead of using color
      to highlight it uses ascii characters around the change.

    * Add Emacs mode to highlight url.list, it is likely to be in error, a user
      help with it would be most helpful as I'm not an Emacs user.

    * Add ViM syntax file to highlight url.list.

    * Fixed usage of environment variables in definitions, also allowed using
      multiple environment variables in a single line.

    * Handle Content-Encoding: gzip, but if the Compress::Gzip module is not
      available don't just die.

1.6.0 - Released on 05 May 2003

    * Added DateFMT feature to set Date Formats in mail subjects.

    * Add to EmailLink the local file system link so that a user can open it in
      his browser.

    * Add Program option to open a program on changed link instead of mailing
      notification.

    * Multiple bug fixes.

1.5.0 - Released on 02 May 2003

    * Added UserAgent option to control the user agent sent by the web client.
      This enables access to websites which lockdown unknown browsers.

    * Enabled the user to run websec from the current directory without the
      multi-user ~/.websec/ setup, the multi-user setup is the default unless
      you run websec from a directory with the url.list file.

    * Allow using environment variables in config file, this enables things
      like: Email = ${USER}@example.com

    * Moved the manpages to pod and into the files, this enables fancy options
      such as -help and -man to work and reduces duplication of effort.

1.4.0 - Released on 31 Oct 2002

    * Various changes that came from the Debian package

1.3.4 - Released on 6 Jun 2000

    * Added tip on how to install LWP in READE. Thanks to Jeff for contributing
      this info!

    * Fixed a bug with $emailLink and added digest format. Thanks to Matti Airas
      for contributing this!

1.3.3 - Released on 31 Jan 2000

    * Added MIME-Version header to email sent. Thanks to Joe Rumsey for pointing
      this out. This fixes problems under certain mailers, where messages are
      treated as plain text instead of HTML.

1.3.2 - Released on 2 Dec 1999

    * Added <CODE> as a recognized tag.

    * Added the ability to send updated page to multiple recipients.

    * Added the ability to send URL link instead of entire page to recipients.
      Check "EmailLink" tag.

    * "Alexander Lazic" <al@eunet.at> suggested using strftime instead of the
      Unix command "date". This has been fixed.

1.31 - Released on 17 Apr 1999

    * Volker Stampa contributed some code to allow websec to work with proxies
      that require authentication.

1.3  - Released on 20 Mar 1999

    * Trevor Boicey suggested allowing the use of arbitrary HTML colors in the
      "-hicolor" parameter of webdiff. This feature has been included.

    * Webdiff had some problems with a tag of this nature:
      <A HREF="xxx <yyy>">, first found in the ZDNET series of web sites.  This
      has been fixed.

    * A new "ignore URL" feature has been included. This allows certain
      hyperlinks sections in a web page to be skipped during webdiff
      processing.

    * All ignore keywords and URLs have been consolidated into one file.

1.22 - Released on 13 Jan 1999

    * A small shell script has been included to "rollback" the files in the
      archive directory for one session.

    * Proxy settings can now be supplied via the "http_proxy" environment
      variable. However, the "Proxy" parameter will take precedence over the
      environment variable.

    * When checking for short and long tokens (based on the Tmin and Tmax
      parameters), any mangled HTML tags are first stripped from the token
      before word count is done.  Therefore, word count is done on the "plain
      text" version of the token.

    * When checking for ignore keywords, the token which possibly contains
      mangled HTML tags is first checked. Then it is stripped of any mangled
      HTML tags and checked again. This is cater for cases where the mangled
      HTML tag precedes or follows an actual word without any spacing. Hence
      the entire string is treated as one word, and will fail to match any of
      the ignore keywords.

1.21 - Released on 1 Jan 1999 (Happy New Year!)

    * Made minor modification to try downloading any URL up to 3 times before
      giving up. I did not find it necessary to include this as a parameter, so
      it was hard-coded.

1.2  - Released on 25 Dec 1998 (Merry Christmas!)

    * Rewrote Web Secretary to use the LWP module in Perl for HTTP retrieval and
      email transmission. Hence, it is no longer necessary to have 'lynx' and
      'metasend' installed on your system in order to use Web Secretary.

    * Since Web Secretary was rewritten to use the LWP module (instead of lynx),
      for HTTP retrieval, I had to add a 'Proxy' parameter for folks (like
      myself) who are behind a firewall.

    * Added the 'Tmin' parameter to ignore short tokens when highlighting
      differences. This is useful because certain sites have tokens containing
      one or two words which change constantly but are uninteresting to track.

    * Added the 'Tmax' parameter to prevent long tokens from being processed by
      the ignore keywords filter. This was included because certain sites have
      tokens containing the current day/month etc. which I want to filter off.
      But at the same time, I do not want to filter off long paragraphs that
      contain these words.

1.11 - Released on 10 Oct 1998

    * Minor modification to the comparison algorithm so that it won't be fooled
      by extra spaces in the tokens.

1.1  - Released on 25 Sep 1998

    * Improved the detection algorithm for multiple consecutive mangled HTML
      tags so that they will not be incorrectly highlighted.

    * Support for Javascript and stylesheet tags so that they will not be
      incorrectly highlighted.

1.0  - First released on 4 Sep 1998.

    The idea for this tool originated from a software package called Tierra
    Highlights for the PC (http://www.tierra.com). I tried it out for a while
    and found it to be extremely useful.  However, like most PC tools, it was
    closely tied to the PC that you installed the software on. If you are
    working on some other computer, you will not be unable to access the pages
    being monitored. At that time, I was already convinced that email is the
    best "push" platform the world has ever seen, so why not deliver the changed
    pages via email?

    I bounced the idea around for a while amongst friends and colleagues, and
    when I could not find any sucker to write this for me :-), I wrote the first
    version in a crazy moment of unrest using shell script. However, this first
    version was not very configurable, so I quickly wrote the second version in
    Perl.

    So far, however, the program does nothing but retrieve pages and email them
    to me. I quickly added a quick hack to do a diff between an archive page
    and the current page before deciding whether to email the page, but the
    scheme proved too brittle for detecting changes in most cases.

    I lived with this scheme for a while. Finally, lunacy got the better of me.
    I figured out a quick and dirty way of doing what Tierra Highlights does,
    and actually thought I could implement the whole idea in one day. It took
    two days instead, and the initial version sucked like hell and failed
    miserably on many pages. However, you should have seen the grin on my face
    when it highlighted PC Magazine and PC Week properly. :-)

    Like most programmers who are crazy enough to think that they can "do this
    thing in one day", I spent the next two weeks feverishly debugging the
    project. Everyday, I will add new pages to the URL list, and debug those
    that failed to be highlighted. Finally, I have something which I use on a
    daily basis now and is prepared to share with the rest of the world.
