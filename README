WEB SECRETARY Version 1.6.0


1. OVERVIEW

Web Secretary is a web page monitoring software. However, it goes beyond the
normal functionalities offered by such software. Not only does it detect
changes based on content analysis (instead of date/time stamp or simple
textual comparison), it will email the changed page to you WITH THE NEW
CONTENT HIGHLIGHTED!

Web Secretary is actually a suite of two Perl scripts called websec and
webdiff. websec retrieves web pages and email them to you based on a URL
list that you provide. webdiff compares two web pages (current and archive)
and creates a new page based on the current page but with all the
differences highlighted using a predefined color.

Personally, I put Web Secretary on crontab to monitor a large number of web
pages. When the highlighted pages are delivered to me, I use procmail to
sort them out and file them into another folder. Sometimes, when I am busy,
I will not have time to accessing the web for a few days. However, with Web
Secretary, I can always access the "archive" that it has created for me at
my own leisure.


2. DEPENDENCIES

Web Secretary should be able to run on all Unix systems with a Perl
interpreter (and LWP module) installed. At present, it has only been tested
on Linux. Users report that it works on Windows too using ActiveState Perl.


3. INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

Installing Web Secretary is easy.

- Un-tar the distribution. The files will be uncompressed into a directory
  called websec/.

- Change directory to websec/.

- Edit the first lines in websec and webdiff to reflect the actual location
  of the Perl interpreter on your system.

- Edit the URL list called url.list. Please refer to SECTION 5 for more
  information on this.

- Edit the ignore keyword/URL file "ignore.list". Please refer to SECTION 6
  and 7 for more information on this file.


4. USAGE 

You can run Web Secretary whenever you want to monitor the changes in your
URL list by typing 'websec'.

Alternatively, you can add Web Secretary to your crontab and run it on a
regular basis (eg. daily). You can even have different URL list files and
run them at different intervals (eg. hourly, daily, weekly etc.)

It goes without saying that you can use Web Secretary to monitor its own
homepage so that you can be informed of the latest news and updates.

5. DIGEST

This feature is contributed by Matti Airas:

> Hi,

> I noticed a small bug in websec. Since I'm using a text-based MUA, I'm
> not interested in getting the HTML pages, but only the notifications.
> However, on line 214 the recipient email address is $email, not
> $emailLink.

> Also, since I found the separate notification mails inconvenient, I
> implemented a new configuration variable "Digest = false|true", which
> makes the notifications to come in a single email.

> The modified file is attached to this mail. I hope you find it useful.

6. INSTALLING LWP

Websec requires the Perl module 'LWP' to work. The quickest way to install
this module is to type:

> perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::LWP'

at the command line.

Thanks to Jeff for contributing this tip!


7. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

I would like to thank the GNU people. I don't know them personally, but they
have blessed us with free and great tools such as Linux, gcc, emacs, Perl,
fetchmail etc. which I now use on a daily basis. In the trails of their
selfless spirit, I will also like to share Web Secretary in the same way,
and hope many people besides me find it useful.

I would also like to thank Chng Tiak Jung, a friend and mentor who inspires
me to learn at least one new thing everyday. I am sure if he continues at
his current pace, I will never be able to catch up with him!

The article "Some Simpler Applications Using LWP" (http://webreview.com/wr/
pub/97/12/12/bookshelf/index.html) by Clinton Wong in webreview.com inspired
me to modify Web Secretary to use the LWP library for HTTP retrieval and
email transmission.
